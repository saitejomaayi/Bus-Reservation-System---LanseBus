A bus reservation system is a software application that allows customers to book bus tickets online or on mobile. It stores customer information, such as their personal data, frequent trips, and drop-off locations. The system also helps with fleet and trip management, and can include features like: <br />
Seat maps: Allows customers to select their seats <br />
Real-time availability: Shows which seats are available in real time <br />
Payment channels: Allows customers to pay for their tickets using multiple payment methods <br />
Booking and cancellation: Allows customers to make reservations and cancel bookings online <br />
Self-service: Allows customers to manage their trip information without needing to contact customer service <br />
Bus reservation systems can help to improve the customer experience and make the booking process more efficient. They can also help businesses to increase conversion rates and reduce the risk of human error.<br />
